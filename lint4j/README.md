# Lint4j

This project has one source file name Demo.java with a bunch of methods that are named according to a problem that (lint4j) can find.

For Example:
```
  public void assignmentNoEffect() {
	int x = 5;
	x = x;
  }
```
In this method this assignment has no effect.
```
	x = x;
```
Lint4j finds this problem and reports it to you with this dialog.
```
   [lint4j] /src/edu/ucsb/cs56/projects/tutorials/lint_style_programs/Demo.java:7: (1): Statement has no effect, possible scoping problem
```
It tells you the line that this problem occurs. It also returns a numerical value according to the severity of the problem. The number ranges from 1 to 5 where 1 is the most severe and 5 is a suggestion.

Demo.java has mulitple problems that lint4j can detect. You can view them all by viewing the text file tmp/lint.out Then you look at Demo.java and connect the problems to the line of code lint4j specifies. Also, Demo.java has comments where lint4j problem occurs.


How to install lint4j to your build.xml

* download a jar and copy it to your lib directory
The download can be found at http://www.jutils.com/download.html
Dowload the zip file and extract it. Then copy the lint4j.jar file that is located in the jars/ directory to your projects lib/ directory.
* add some code to the build.xml
```
  </target> 
  <taskdef name="lint4j" classname="com.jutils.lint4j.ant.Lint4jAntTask">
    <classpath>
      <pathelement location="lib/lint4j.jar" />
    </classpath>
  </taskdef>

  <target name="lint" description="runs lint4j on source files" >
    <mkdir dir = "tmp" />
    <lint4j sourcepath="src"
	    classpath="lib/junit-4.8.2.jar"
	    packages="${pkgName}.*"
	    level="5"
	    exact="false" >
      <formatters>
	<formatter type="text" />
	<formatter type="text" toFile="tmp/lint.out"/>
      </formatters> 
    </lint4j>
  </target>
```
Add this to any existing build.xml that is set up in a package structure or it won't work. Make sure the variable (pkgName) is defined to your specific package name. This target is set up to copy the detected problems to tmp/lint.out so your build.xml should reflect that. For ex. clean target deletes tmp/ directory.
